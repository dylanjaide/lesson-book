It was a dark and stormy night, and Throckmorton was scared of the dark.
Fortunately, I am not scared of the dark, plus also I'd brought a lamp.
Although that didn't really matter, because we were inside, plus the lights were on.
We began packing our supplies to set out on our journey.
Throcky had an expensive camping rucksack, that his dad (my uncle) had bought him for getting an A in his Geography mock.
I had a Pikachu backpack that I got from ComicCon one year.
It was kind of falling apart, but it meant a lot to me, because Jennette McCurdy had signed it.
I wonder what she's doing these days - is she still an actor?
I thought about how the answer to that question wouldn't make our journey any less challenging.
We got a good night's sleep, and set out in the morning.

I was struggling to keep up with Throckmorton since he was immune to the force of drag. As well as tall.
